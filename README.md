# This a simple blockchain implementation.


It's about to create many block of data using arraylist and in each block contain a hash of data of the previous block
except the initial block. And in this way the block of chain will be secure and imposible to hack beacause if someone modify data in one block, the others will nkow that something was change(the hash in each block will change) or corrupted and the contract, the operation, will fail.
